The NeuroNormpackage contains the code for preprocessing structural MRI for multiple Neurodegenerative Diseases. It comes as an extension of the master thesis **Detection and Classification of Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Spatially Informed Bayesian neural Network**. 

The package can be installed as follows, given that you have `devtools` installed in advance.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DavidPayares/neuronorm")
```
