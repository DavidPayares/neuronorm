# The neuronorm package <img src="neuro_sticker.png" align="right" width="180" />

The dockless package contains the code for preprocessing structural MRI for multiple Neurodegenerative Diseases. It comes as an extension of the master thesis **Detection and Classification of Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Spatially Informed Bayesian neural Network**. The package can be installed as follows, given that you have `devtools` installed in advance.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github('DavidPayares/neuronorm')
```
